# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard  
A Power BI dashboard providing deep insights into survival patterns, clinical risk factors, and demographic influences among heart disease patients. This report translates medical data into actionable business and healthcare strategies aimed at improving outcomes and preventive care.

---

## Project Overview  
This dashboard analyzes patient survival, mortality patterns, and risk determinants using key clinical and lifestyle variables such as serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking.

Using the dataset (203 survivors, 96 deaths), the dashboard identifies high-risk groups and provides actionable steps hospitals can take to improve early detection, resource allocation, and patient monitoring.

## Key Dashboard Insights  

### **1. Survival Overview**  
- **Survival Rate:** 67.89%  
- **Average Survival Age:** 58.76 years  
- **Survivors:** 203  
- **Deaths:** 96  

**Meaning:**  
Nearly one-third of patients do not survive, highlighting the need for enhanced cardiac screening, faster diagnostics, and better management of high-risk patients.

---

### **2. Age-Based Insights**  
- Highest survival counts in **51–60** and **61–70** groups.  
- Sharp decline in survival for **<40** and **>70** groups.  

**Business interpretation:**  
Hospitals should strengthen monitoring protocols for elderly groups and introduce aggressive preventive programs for middle-aged populations.

---

### **3. Clinical Predictors of Mortality**  
- **High Serum Creatinine (≥1.5 mg/dL)** → strong indicator of death risk  
- **Low Ejection Fraction (<40%)** → poor heart pumping efficiency  
- **High Blood Pressure & Diabetes** → amplify mortality risk  

**Interpretation:**  
Serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the strongest predictors. These should be monitored in real time for every cardiac admission.

---

### **4. Lifestyle & Comorbid Factors**  
- Smoking, anemia, diabetes, and high blood pressure heavily impact mortality.  
- Highest burden observed in the **51–70** age range.

**Business meaning:**  
Prevention clinics (BP, diabetes, smoking cessation) can significantly improve outcomes while adding revenue through wellness programs.

---

### **5. Gender Insights**  
- Males form the larger share of death occurrences.  
- Female survival rate is slightly higher.

---

## Business Impact Summary  

- Late diagnosis and unmanaged comorbidities increase mortality risk.  
- High-risk patients require coordinated cardiology–nephrology care.  
- Hospitals can reduce inpatient costs by promoting preventive screenings.  
- Improved survival enhances hospital reputation and patient retention.  

---

## Strategic Recommendations  

### **1. Improve Survival Outcomes**  
- Mandatory cardiac screening for patients aged **45+**  
- Fast-track ECG & echocardiogram testing  
- Automatic alerts for abnormal creatinine or low ejection fraction  

### **2. Strengthen Preventive Care**  
- Introduce Heart Wellness Packages  
- Smoking & BP management clinics  
- Monthly diabetes follow-ups  

### **3. Enhance High-Risk Patient Care**  
- Dedicated cardiac monitoring beds  
- Multispecialty care teams for comorbidity clusters  

### **4. Data-Driven Enhancements**  
- Predictive models for survival probability  
- Post-discharge follow-up automation  
- Real-time integration with lab systems  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Machine learning risk scoring  
- Drug adherence monitoring  
- IoT-based remote vitals tracking  
- 360° patient history integration
